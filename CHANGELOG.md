## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-05

### Changed

- Official support narrowed to **Windsurf** and **OpenCode** only. Cursor, Claude Code, and Trae integrations removed.
- Restructured repository: removed `.cursor/`, `.cursor-plugin/`, `.trae/`, `.claude/`, and `plugins/` directories.
- Main `README.md` rewritten to focus on Windsurf and OpenCode installation and usage.
- `.windsurf/README.md` updated — Windsurf is now a first-class platform, not an adaptation.
- `scripts/install-workflow-bridge.mjs` rewritten for Windsurf and OpenCode only.
- `docs/english/other-editors.md` and `docs/portuguese/other-editors.md` rewritten to document Windsurf and OpenCode setup.

### Added

- `.opencode/` directory with full OpenCode adaptation: 20 commands, 46 agents, 21 skills, consolidated rules in `AGENTS.md`.

### Removed

- `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.cursor-plugin/`, `.trae/`, `plugins/` directories and all contained files.
- `scripts/install-plugin-local.sh` and `scripts/install-claude-code.sh`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- Introduced a complete prefixed command suite (`/pwf-*`) with dedicated commands for setup, docs operations, quality gates, and specialized work lanes.
- Added reusable workflow assets and specialist agents for architecture docs, infrastructure docs, ADR generation, review mapping, and plan synchronization.
- Added new documentation guides in English and Portuguese, including suggested project structure and under-the-hood architecture.

### Changed

- Refined command orchestration to reduce duplication by extracting baseline loading and docs maintenance into shared skills.
- Expanded workflow documentation and wiki generation with curated language hubs, clearer onboarding flows, and improved deep-link navigation.
- Standardized plugin policies and guardrails for command naming, docs scope boundaries, operational behavior, and commit/release safety.

### Fixed

- Corrected command and docs path consistency after command-family migration, including anti-drift docs handling and setup behavior.
- Improved release checks and template validation coverage to catch metadata/version drift earlier.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-03-16

### Changed

- Removed `aws-cli-only.mdc` and `user-facing-text.mdc` from the plugin rules (project-specific rules that do not belong in the generic workflow plugin).
- Added `commits.mdc` to the repository-level `.cursor/rules/` (maintainer-only convention, not part of the installable plugin).
- Cleaned up stale references to removed rules in `skills/angular-conventions/SKILL.md`, `agents/research/ux-consistency-reviewer.md`, and `plugins/psters-ai-workflow/README.md`.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-03-16

### Removed

- `docs/english/add-a-plugin.md` and `docs/portuguese/add-a-plugin.md`: leftover template files, removed from all READMEs and docs indexes.
- Removed all references in `README.md`, `plugins/psters-ai-workflow/README.md`, `docs/english/README.md`, `docs/portuguese/README.md`, and all `.wiki-export/` variants.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- New documentation page: "Using the workflow outside Cursor" (EN and PT-BR):
  - `docs/english/other-editors.md`
  - `docs/portuguese/other-editors.md`
  - Covers: why Cursor is recommended (Marketplace auto-updates, hooks, agents), Claude Code setup (slash commands), Windsurf, VS Code + GitHub Copilot, and generic approach for any AI tool.
  - Includes feature comparison table across tools.
- Updated `README.md` (EN and PT-BR install sections): added link to other-editors doc, idempotency note for the install script, and Marketplace auto-update note.
- Updated `docs/english/README.md` and `docs/portuguese/README.md`: added `other-editors.md` to the file index.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed

- Mermaid diagram rendering errors on GitHub caused by `/` at the start of node labels (e.g. `[/brainstorm]` parsed as trapezoid shape). Wrapped all such labels in quotes (`["/brainstorm"]`).
- Affected files: `README.md`, `docs/english/workflow-methodology.md`, `docs/portuguese/workflow-methodology.md`, `docs/english/extreme-programming.md`, `docs/portuguese/extreme-programming.md`, and all `.wiki-export/` variants.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- Model selection guidance across planning and execution steps:
  - New section in `docs/english/workflow-methodology.md`: "Choosing the right model for each step"
  - New section in `docs/portuguese/workflow-methodology.md`: "Escolhendo o modelo certo para cada etapa"
  - New section in `README.md` (EN and PT-BR): model recommendation table per command
  - Covers rationale: planning steps (`/brainstorm`, `/plan`, `/review`) require high-capability models; execution steps (`/work-plan`, `/work`) work well with mid-tier models in auto mode

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- Maintainer release automation script:
  - `scripts/release-plugin.sh`
- Repository-level maintainer workflow helpers:
  - `.cursor/commands/develop-plugin.md`
  - `.cursor/commands/release-plugin.md`
  - `.cursor/rules/plugin-maintainer-flow.mdc`
- Claude-focused maintainer helpers:
  - `.claude/README.md`
  - `.claude/commands/develop-plugin.md`
  - `.claude/commands/release-plugin.md`
  - `.claude/agents/plugin-submission-reviewer.md`
  - `.claude/agents/plugin-release-manager.md`
- README section documenting the maintainer release flow.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- Local manual installer script for the plugin:
  - `scripts/install-plugin-local.sh`

### Changed

- Updated getting-started docs (EN/PT) to use the installer script instead of manual copy commands.
- Refined command UX for all plugin commands by rewriting each command's first title and opening explanation for clearer discoverability and faster understanding in the command picker.
  - `/brainstorm` -> Step 1 framing
  - `/plan` -> Step 2 framing
  - `/work-plan` -> Step 3 framing
  - `/review` -> Step 4 framing
  - `/commit-changes` -> Step 5 framing
  - `/work`, `/doc`, `/compound`, `/deploy-lambda` -> concise purpose-first titles and first-line guidance
