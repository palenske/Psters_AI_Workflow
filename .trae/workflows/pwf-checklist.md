# Generate Requirement Quality Checklists

Checklists here are "unit tests for requirements writing", not QA test cases for implementation behavior.

## Input

<checklist_input> #$ARGUMENTS </checklist_input>

If empty, ask: "Which plan should I generate checklists for? (e.g. `docs/plans/20260312-feature-plan.md`)"

---

## Step 1: Resolve target and scope

1. Resolve target plan (`docs/plans/*.md`) from input.
2. Parse requested domains from input; default domains:
   - `api`
   - `ux`
   - `security`
   - `data`
   - `observability`
3. Read target plan and any relevant docs:
   - `docs/modules/*`, `docs/features/*`, `docs/lambdas/*` as applicable.

---

## Step 2: Generate checklist items by quality dimension

For each domain, write checks that evaluate requirements quality:

- Completeness
- Clarity
- Consistency
- Measurability
- Scenario coverage
- Edge-case coverage
- Dependencies and assumptions

### Prohibited checklist style

- Do NOT write implementation tests like "verify endpoint returns 200".
- Do NOT reference runtime clicks/assertions.

### Required checklist style

- Ask whether requirements are clearly and fully specified.
- Use markers such as `[Completeness]`, `[Clarity]`, `[Consistency]`, `[Coverage]`, `[Edge Case]`, `[Gap]`.

---

## Step 3: Write checklist files

Create folder:

- `docs/plans/<plan-slug>/checklists/`

Create one file per domain:

- `api.md`, `ux.md`, `security.md`, `data.md`, `observability.md`

Item format:

```markdown
- [ ] CHK001 Are error response requirements specified for all API failure classes? [Completeness]
```

If a checklist file already exists, append new items and continue CHK numbering.

---

## Output

Report:
- checklist directory path,
- files created/updated,
- total items per domain,
- top requirement gaps identified.

## Next Recommended Commands

- `/pwf-analyze <same plan path>` to detect coverage and consistency gaps
- `/pwf-clarify <same plan path>` if major ambiguities remain
- `/pwf-work-plan <same plan path> Phase N` after checklist gaps are addressed
