# Step 3 — Execute One Planned Phase

Use this command to execute one phase from `docs/plans/` with full discipline: read docs first, implement, build, and update docs.
Apply `skills/using-psters-workflow/SKILL.md` at start.

## Documentation Intent (Read This First)

Docs updated during `/pwf-work-plan` must become reliable implementation memory for future phases and future AI runs.

Do not write generic summaries. Document:

- what is already implemented in code after this phase,
- what remains planned in later phases,
- where to edit safely next time,
- and which constraints must not be violated.

## ⛔ MANDATORY WORKFLOW — NEVER SKIP ANY STEP

You MUST execute steps 1 through 5 IN ORDER. Do NOT jump to implementation.
Your FIRST action must be reading the plan file and documentation (Step 1), NOT editing code.
If you skip Step 1 or Step 4, the workflow is BROKEN.

---

## Input

<plan_input> $ARGUMENTS </plan_input>

If empty or not pointing to a plan file, ask: "Which plan file? (e.g. `docs/plans/20260312-feat-xyz-plan.md`)"

---

## Step 1: Load Context (BLOCKING — must complete before any code changes)

**Your first tool calls MUST be Read calls. Do NOT start implementing.**

Before Step 1 execution details, note that extension hooks like `before_work_plan` provide advisory guidance only (no script execution in OpenCode).

1. **Read the plan file** fully.
   - Validate task format in target phase:
     - `- [ ] T### [P?] [USx?] Description with file path`
   - If format is inconsistent, normalize the phase task list before execution (or ask user to run `/pwf-plan` refinement).

2. **Identify the target phase** — first ⬜ Pending phase, or the one specified by the user. If the argument names a phase number (e.g. "Phase 2"), start at that phase.

3. **Load docs baseline via skill (REQUIRED):**
   - Apply `skills/docs-baseline-loading/SKILL.md`.
   - Read mandatory baseline docs before implementation.
   - Create missing canonical baseline docs immediately using the skill's required minimum sections.
   - Then read phase-specific docs:
     - `docs/solutions/patterns/critical-patterns.md` (if exists)
     - `docs/modules/<module>.md` (backend scope)
     - `docs/features/<feature>.md` (frontend scope)
     - `docs/lambdas/<repo>.md` (Lambda scope)
     - `docs/runbooks/README.md` (operational/deploy scope)
     - relevant `docs/solutions/` entries by feature keywords
   - **If any other expected doc file is missing:** create it immediately with a useful baseline. Minimum sections:
     - `Purpose`
     - `Source of Truth Files`
     - `Current Implementation Snapshot`
     - `Phase Scope (Current Plan)` with explicit `planned` markers
     - `Invariants and Gotchas`
     - `Safe Change Checklist for Future AI Work`
     - `Related Plan and Docs`

4. **Present summary to user:** Phase name, objective, task count. Get confirmation to proceed.

5. **Ticket number:** If not in plan frontmatter, ask once: "Do you have a ticket number (TICKET-XXXX) for commit messages?"

6. **Create TodoWrite** task list directly from the plan phase task IDs (T001, T002...) in dependency order.
   - Preserve `[P]` markers as parallel opportunities.
   - Preserve `[USx]` labels for traceability in status updates.
   - If user explicitly requested TDD and plan contains test-first tasks, preserve red-green-refactor order.

### Definition of Ready (BLOCKING)

Before Step 2, confirm all are true:

1. Critical ambiguities resolved (or explicitly marked with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]`).
2. Tasks have IDs + file paths and executable scope.
3. Acceptance criteria are measurable for this phase.
4. Main risks/dependencies are explicit.
5. Required docs/pattern references were loaded.

---

## Step 2: Execute

For each task in the phase:

- Mark in progress in TodoWrite.
- Read the referenced files. Follow project rules and existing patterns from docs read in Step 1.
- Implement the task.
- Mark task completed in TodoWrite.

If a task is primarily bug/debug oriented, follow `skills/systematic-debugging/SKILL.md` before attempting larger fixes.
Playbook mapping:
- deep stack/source uncertainty -> `skills/systematic-debugging/root-cause-tracing.md`
- async timing/flaky behavior -> `skills/systematic-debugging/condition-based-waiting.md`
- regression hardening after fix -> `skills/systematic-debugging/defense-in-depth.md`

If user explicitly requested TDD for this phase, apply `skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md` for relevant tasks only.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Database Migration Atomic Chain (when applicable)

Follow the migration discipline from the relevant skill (e.g., `skills/typeorm/SKILL.md` or `skills/prisma/SKILL.md`) for your ORM (generate -> drift-check -> local run). Treat this as blocking. Do not continue other tasks until the chain succeeds.

### Built-in capabilities (use as needed during execution):

- **Operational policy source:** `AGENTS.md (#operational-guardrails)`
- **Project overrides (optional):** `docs/workflow/operational-overrides.md` (if present, it overrides defaults from AGENTS.md)
- **Database access:** Load DB vars from `backend/.env` (or project-specific env) for psql queries when applicable. Never display credentials.
- **Context7:** Use the Context7 MCP (`resolve-library-id` then `query-docs`) before implementing with external libraries.

### After all tasks:

1. **Build** — `npm run build` in every affected repo. Fix ALL errors before continuing.
2. **Update plan file:**
   - Mark the phase as `✅ Completed` in the Implementation Plan table.
   - In the `## ✅ Master Checklist`, mark each completed task: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`.

---

## Step 3: Quality Review

**Only run if the phase changed 5+ files or touched multiple repos.** Otherwise skip to Step 4.

If triggered, execute review agents by reading and applying their instructions:

1. Read `.opencode/assets/review-agent-selection-mapping.md` to select applicable agents based on changed scope.
2. For each selected agent, read its agent file and execute the review instructions.
3. You can read multiple agent files in parallel.

Address **critical** findings before finishing. Informational findings are noted but don't block.

---

## Step 4: Documentation Maintenance (MANDATORY — never skip)

**This step is MANDATORY even for small changes.**

Apply `skills/docs-maintenance-after-work/SKILL.md` and execute its full flow:
- always run `doc-shepherd`,
- run `plan-sync` for plan/work-plan synchronization,
- run specialized doc writers conditionally,
- run `pattern-extractor` when applicable,
- pass the documentation quality gate before Step 5.

---

## Step 5: Finish

Summarize: what was implemented, files changed, any deferred items.

### Verification Evidence (MANDATORY before completion claims)

Before claiming phase completion/fix success, apply `skills/verification-before-completion/SKILL.md` and use the evidence format from `AGENTS.md (#operational-guardrails)`.

Include a dedicated **Documentation updates** subsection:

- docs files updated/created
- what high-value operational knowledge was added
- checklist/phase sync status
- any explicit doc debt left for next phase

Suggest next steps:
- **Next phase** → continue with `/pwf-work-plan [same plan path] Phase N+1`
- **Commit** with ticket number
- **`/pwf-review`** for full PR review (if all phases done or before merge)
- **`/pwf-doc-capture`** if a non-trivial bug was fixed during the phase
- **`/pwf-aws-lambda-deploy`** reminder if Lambda repos were touched
- **`/pwf-analyze [same plan path]`** if inconsistencies emerge during execution
- apply `skills/finishing-a-development-branch/SKILL.md` when phase/branch work is fully complete

Before finalizing, note that `after_work_plan` extensions provide advisory guidance only (no script execution in OpenCode).

## Conventions

- Follow canonical policy in `AGENTS.md (#operational-guardrails)`
- Follow commit policy in `AGENTS.md (#commit-messages)`
- Use optional project overrides in `docs/workflow/operational-overrides.md` when present.
