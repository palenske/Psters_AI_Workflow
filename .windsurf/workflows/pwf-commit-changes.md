name: pwf-commit-changes
description: >
  Commit uncommitted changes across all workspace repos, tagging commits with ticket numbers from pasted issue text. Spawns one parallel subagent per repo — each analyzes every changed file, groups them by ticket, and makes multiple focused commits independently.
argument-hint: "[paste issue(s) with TICKET-XXX and metadata, or list TICKET-XXX]"

# Step 5 — Create Structured Commits

Use this command to produce high-quality, ticket-aware commits after review, including multi-repo parallel commit organization when needed.

Each repo gets its own subagent that:
1. Inspects every changed file individually
2. Groups files by which ticket they relate to
3. Makes **multiple focused commits** — one per ticket group (plus separate commits for unrelated changes)

All repos run **in parallel**.

## Input

<commit_changes_input> #$ARGUMENTS </commit_changes_input>

If empty, ask:
> "Paste the issue(s) or list the ticket number(s) (e.g. TICKET-727, TICKET-726), then I'll commit all uncommitted changes with organized, per-ticket commits."

---

## Phase 1 — Parse Tickets

Extract every ticket identifier and its short title from the pasted text:

- Look for `Identifier: TICKET-XXX` lines; the title is the `# Heading` above it (or after the last `------` separator).
- Build a list: `[{ id: "TICKET-727", title: "Move the BACK TO TABLE button to the right side" }, ...]`
- If no ticket is found, subagents will still commit with descriptive subjects but no `[TICKET-XXX]` prefix.

---

## Phase 2 — Discover Repos With Changes

For each **workspace path** (all paths from context — `backend`, `frontend`, `*-lambda`, etc.):

1. Run: `git -C <path> status --short`
2. Skip if not a git repo (exit code ≠ 0) or output is empty.
3. Record the repo path and name for repos that have uncommitted changes.

> **Note:** Do NOT collect diffs here. Each subagent will fetch its own per-file diffs in Step 2 of its workflow, allowing precise file-level ticket classification.

Build a list: `[{ path, name }]` of repos with uncommitted changes.

---

## Phase 3 — Spawn One Subagent Per Repo (All in Parallel)

> **Skill reference:** Read `skills/commit-changes-repo-worker/SKILL.md` once before spawning subagents to understand the multi-commit worker contract.

For each repo with uncommitted changes, invoke **one `generalPurpose` subagent** (model: `fast`) using the Task tool. All invocations run **simultaneously**.

Use this prompt template per repo:

---

```
You are a focused git commit worker for a single repository.
Read the skill at skills/commit-changes-repo-worker/SKILL.md for full instructions.

## Your inputs

REPO_PATH: {REPO_PATH}
REPO_NAME: {REPO_NAME}

## Ticket list

{TICKET_LIST}
(e.g.
- TICKET-727: Move the BACK TO TABLE button to the right side
- TICKET-726: Text input widget doesn't allow user to click inside
- TICKET-734: This error pops randomly after being dormant
- TICKET-732: Error when viewing TASK DETAILS
- TICKET-729: When I change the LEAD to a HO, they should be added as CONTRIBUTOR
)

## Instructions

Follow the commit-changes-repo-worker skill exactly:
1. Discover all changed files with `git -C {REPO_PATH} status --short`
2. Fetch per-file diffs and classify each file to the most relevant ticket (or NONE)
3. Group files by ticket
4. Make one focused commit per group (stage specific files only — never git add -A)
5. Return the JSON report with the `commits` array

Constraints: no branches, no push, no interactive git commands, no bulk staging.
```

---

Collect all JSON responses when subagents finish.

---

## Phase 4 — Summarize

Parse each subagent's JSON response. For each repo, print one row per commit:

| Repo | Ticket | Commit message | Files | Result |
|------|--------|----------------|-------|--------|
| frontend | TICKET-727 | `[TICKET-727] 🐛 fix(tasks): move back-to-table btn to right` | 2 files | ✅ |
| frontend | TICKET-726 | `[TICKET-726] 🐛 fix(text-input): allow click inside widget` | 1 file | ✅ |
| backend  | TICKET-729 | `[TICKET-729] 🚀 feat(projects): add lead as contributor on demotion` | 3 files | ✅ |
| backend  | NONE    | `🔧 chore(migrations): add project lead contributor migration` | 1 file | ✅ |

Then show a quick summary line:
> "X repos committed, Y commits total. All commits are local only — push each repo when ready."

If any commit **failed**, show the error and suggest: "Fix the issue and re-run `/pwf-commit-changes` for that repo."

---

## Commit Rules (rules/commits.mdc — always enforced)

- **Format**: `[TICKET-XXXX] <emoji> <type>(<scope>): <subject>`
- **English only** — subject and all commit text in English.
- **Imperative mood** — "add", "fix", "remove" (not "added"/"adds").
- **Subject ≤ 50 chars** (not counting `[TICKET-XXXX]` prefix and emoji/type).
- **Emoji required** — always pick from the type reference table.
- **Ticket as prefix only** — never inside the subject line.
- **No branches, no push** — targeted `git add <files>` + `git commit` on current branch only.
- **No bulk staging** — never `git add -A`; stage only the files belonging to each commit group.

---

## Architecture Note

Each repo subagent (generalPurpose, model: fast) handles the full lifecycle for its repo:
**file discovery → per-file diff → ticket classification → grouping → multiple targeted commits → JSON report.**

All subagents run in parallel. The main agent only orchestrates phases 1–2 and 4.
This produces organized, reviewable git history — one commit per ticket per repo.

## Next Recommended Commands

- `/pwf-review` if commits should be preceded by a final risk check
- `/pwf-aws-lambda-deploy` if Lambda code was committed and is ready to deploy
